# ðŸŒ¬ apprise-it-for-me

... is a gateway for [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise):

`apprise-it-for-me` accepts HTTP POST data, transforms it into an Apprise notification payload and sends it to an [Apprise API server](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api/).

[Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise):
> allows you to send a notification to almost all of the most popular notification services available to us today such as: Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon SNS, Gotify, etc.

## Rationale

Many applications realize notifications via generic webhooks among others.
Some of them allow the user to configure the data structure of the webhook request.
Others don't.

Apprise, on the other hand, expects a predefined data structure.

`apprise-it-for-me` can provide application specific webhooks, convert the incoming request data and forward it to Apprise.

## Usage

### Common

1. Typically `apprise-it-for-me` is configured as generic webhook.
   The webhook url follows this pattern:

   > http://`{APPRISE-IT-FOR-ME-SERVER}`:5000/from_`{APPLICATION}`/notify/`{APPRISE-KEY}`

   e.g.: http://metrics.local:5000/from_grafana/notify/to-ntfy

2. Any query string is forwarded as-is to Apprise.
   This allows to specify `tag`, `title`, `format` and `type` when not already contained in the incoming request data.
   For details see [apprise-api #84](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api/pull/84).

### Application specific mapping

Application support is currently limited to [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana).

**Grafana:**

The values of the following [`commonLabels` webhook fields](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/manage-notifications/webhook-notifier/) are copied to the Apprise notification payload:
`tag`, `format`, `notification_type`, `title`.

Details see [`application/converter/grafana.py`](application/converter/grafana.py).

## Development environment

To prepare your development execute the following make target.
It initializes a Python virtualenv, installs dependencies and further development tools.
It requires Python to be already installed.
