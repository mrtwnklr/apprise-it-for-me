# ðŸŒ¬ apprise-it-for-me

... is a gateway for [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise):

`apprise-it-for-me` accepts HTTP POST data, transforms it into an Apprise notification payload and sends it to an [Apprise API server](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api/).

[Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise):
> allows you to send a notification to almost all of the most popular notification services available to us today such as: Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon SNS, Gotify, etc.

## Rationale

Many applications realize notifications via generic webhooks among others.
Some of them allow the user to configure the data structure of the webhook request.
Others don't.

Apprise, on the other hand, expects a predefined data structure.

`apprise-it-for-me` can provide application specific webhooks, convert the incoming request data and forward it to Apprise.

## Usage

### Common

1. Typically `apprise-it-for-me` is configured as generic webhook.
   The webhook url follows this pattern:

   > http://`{APPRISE-IT-FOR-ME-SERVER}`:5000/from_`{APPLICATION}`/notify/`{APPRISE-KEY}`

   e.g.: http://metrics.local:5000/from_grafana/notify/to-ntfy

2. Any query string is forwarded as-is to Apprise.
   This allows to specify `tag`, `title`, `format` and `type` when not already contained in the incoming request data.
   For details see [apprise-api #84](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api/pull/84).

### Application specific mapping

Application support is currently limited to [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana).

1. **Grafana:**

   Some fields in the Apprise notification payload are copied from the Grafana main request body.
   Other fields can only be set by providing them as alert labels (see [`commonLabels` webhook fields](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/manage-notifications/webhook-notifier/)).

   |Apprise field     |from Grafana field |override with `commonLabels`
   |-                 |-                  |-
   |body              |message            |-
   |title             |title              |title
   |notification_type |status             |notification_type
   |format            |-                  |format
   |tag               |-                  |tag

   Details see [`application/converter/grafana.py`](application/converter/grafana.py).

## Development

### Prepare environment

1. To prepare your development execute the following make target.
   It initializes a Python virtualenv, installs dependencies and further development tools.
   It requires Python to be already installed.

   ```bash
   make dev-install-virtualenv
   ```

### Run application

1. To adjust configuration variables copy `.env.sample` into `.env` and modify it.

1. To run the development server execute the following make target:

   ```bash
   make dev-run
   ```
